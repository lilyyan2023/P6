                    <h2>2012</h2>
                    <p>When I was 12 years old, I went to a middle school in Shenyang, a larger city in 
                            our province. In the middle school, I learnt many advanced math and science that 
                            allowed me to excel in these fields.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>2015</h2>
                    <p>
                          After deciding to pursue more opportunities in US, I applied to a US high school 
                          called Worcester Academy. It was a wonderful start. I started exploring my way
                          to athletics, science, and math. I joined JV team in soccer and swimming. I also 
                          founded the first science-focused club on campus.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2016</h2>
                    <p> Continuing my exploration in high school, I pivoted to swimming and thanks to my
                            hard work during the summer, I advanced to varsity team in swimming. I challenged 
                            myself a lot in academics this year, which made me realize how to study more efficiently.
                            Sophomore year was definitely a transition in my high school. I also joined our school
                            math team to compete in regional math competitions representing our school.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2017</h2>
                    <p>
                         Junior year was definitely the busiest. I continued to challenge myself academically. It 
                         was also this year, I became our school's math team captain and worked on engaging more
                         members to participate in math contests. Our team were able to advance to statewide competitions 
                         that year and I also represented our school to participate in Harvard and MIT math tournaments.
                    </p>
              
                    <h2>2018</h2>
                    <p> 
                            Senior year, I mainly focused on applying for schools I like. Fortunately, I am able to 
                            get accepted by Northwestern during RD. It was also senior year when I took AP Computer Science and 
                            AP Economics to attract me into CS and Econ.
                    </p>
              
                    <h2>2019</h2>
                    <p>
                        Freshman year, I was super excited to become a college student. I met many interesting and
                        talented wildcats. I got to join .dev, EPIC software team, NU solar car team, Society
                        Of Women Engineer and Spoon. I also took many CS and Econ classes to teach me many professional
                        knowledge.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2020</h2>
                    <p> 
                            2020 started with a mess. COVID19 fiercely hit and I took an adventure to book a flight
                            going back from US back to home. Unfortunately, I was transferred directly to 
                            the local hospital after landing and I spent 6 days in hospital to get many tests to prove
                            that I am free from COVID. Luckily, I didn't have any and went back to normal life after
                            the 14 day quarantine. This summer, I remotely interned in Argonne National Laboratory 
                            which I conducted the first project shown in landing page. Then, I made up my mind to travel
                            back to US, so I am currently located in Evanston, IL.
